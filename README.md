You may read the news about this [application in our article on Medium](https://medium.com/@transistorsoft/background-geolocation-console-45796532c2ee).

## Install

You must have [node.js 14.5.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.5.0/) or later and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

Environment variables:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/geolocation # or skip this line to use sqlite
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIz...vNkg # or skip this line
# Do you use it for a lot of organisation or users?
export SHARED_DASHBOARD=1      # with auth,
# export SHARED_DASHBOARD=1    # empty - without auth,
# Manage them in one account?  http://localhost:8080/admin
export ADMIN_TOKEN=admin256    # admin login
# Do you need auth?
export PASSWORD=test           # admin password
```

For production version please do not forget add your own JWT keys

```
export JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n
export JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----\n...-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----\n
```

### Windows

Please use `set` and 8080 port for dev.

### Firestore

```bash
export FIREBASE_URL=https://YOUR-PROJECT-DATABASE.firebaseio.com
export FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII...=\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
```

[additional details](./src/server/firebase/README.md)

# auth


Database will create automaticaly in non production.

[PgSQL script for production](./postgres/create.sql)

### Production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

production version will available on:

http://localhost:9000/

### Developer mode:

```bash
npm start
```

hot reload version will available on:

http://localhost:9000/


### Tests

Application have a jest api tests

```bash
npm test
```

If you are in an environment that supports opening a web browser, a browser window will automatically launch the front-end web app at the end of the server startup procedure.

## Configure The Sample App

The Background Geolocation [Sample App](https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-background-geolocation-SampleApp) is perfect for use with this web-application.  To configure the app, determine your IP address and pick a unique console username, then simply edit `Settings->url` and set it to `http://<your.ip.ad.dress>:9000/locations/<your-console-username>`.

You may also want to configure `Settings->autoSync` to `false` while out field-testing as well, so that the app doesn't try syncing each recorded location to a possibly unreachable server running on your `localhost`.  Once you return after a test and you're back on your office Wifi, click the **[Sync]** button on the `Settings` screen to upload the cached locations to the **Background Geolocation Console** server.

## Configure Your Own App

As you integrate the background-geolocation plugin with your app, you may find it useful to post locations to the test console to verify your integration.

### React Native &amp; Cordova:
If you want to post to the tracking console in your own app, itâ€™s very easy: The plugin contains a helper method [#transistorTrackerParams](https://transistorsoft.github.io/react-native-background-geolocation-android/classes/_react_native_background_geolocation_android_.backgroundgeolocation.html#transistortrackerparams) to compose a params config suitable for consumption by the server.  It's up to you to provide the `device` plugin instance (*Cordova*: `cordova-plugin-device`, *React Native*: `react-native-device-info`, *Flutter*

```javascript
//
// Configure the BackgroundGeolocation plugin to post to this console
// after modifying the #url / #params below, visit in your browser:
// http://<your.ip.ad.dress>:9000
//

let username = 'your-custom-username';
BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
  url: 'http://<your-ip-address>:9000/locations',
  params: BackgroundGeolocation.transistorTrackerParams(device) // <-- device plugin instance.
}, (state) => {
  BackgroundGeolocation.start();
});
```

### Flutter:
```dart
Map deviceParams = await Config.deviceParams;

BackgroundGeolocation.ready(Config(
    url: 'http://<your.ip.address>:9000/locations',
    params: deviceParams
));
```

## Running on Heroku

You can deploy easily the app on Heroku by pushing the code to your heroku git repository.

Before this, you will need to create 2 environment variables (either in the heroku dashboard, or by executing `heroku config:set <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VARIABLE_VALUE>`) :

- `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION = false` : It will tell heroku to install `devDependencies` (and not only `dependencies`), required to build browserify's `bundle.min.js` file
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = <PUT YOUR KEY HERE>` : A Google Maps API v3 allowed for your heroku domain (see <https://console.developers.google.com>)
- Optionally, `DB_CONNECTION_URL = postgres://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<dbname>` if you want to persist locations
  into a postgresql db (instead of a sqlite db which will be deleted after every heroku shutdown)

And to reference `heroku/nodejs` buildpack (either in the heroku dashboard, or by executing `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`)

## Docker

By default `console` will use SqlLite file storage

NB!: It will clean on conatiner re-creation

Please add volume to store it or setup Postgres/Firebase storage

1. Configurate you own build in [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
2. `docker build -t background-geolocation-console .`
3. `docker run -p 9000:9000 -v /<rootpath>/src/server/database/db:/usr/src/server/database/db -d background-geolocation-console`

Now it available by http://&lt;docker-machine-ip&gt;:9000/

You can run `docker-machine ls` for ip investigation.

## Docker Compose

1) Do not forget create machine `docker-machine create -d "virtualbox" local.geolocation`
2) Setup vars `eval $(docker-machine env local.geolocation)`
3) `docker-compose up` in root dir

Now it available by http://&lt;docker-machine-ip&gt;/

You can run `docker-machine ls` for ip investigation.

Please do not forget set up `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` too.
